# MeqTrees frontend
This repository serves as the new home
for the MeqTrees system GUI, which previously lived in Meqtrees Timba (the C++ compute graph backend and pipeliner backbone of the system).

To use the frontend GUI you currently need Qt4 and Qwt4, along with the various Python 3.6 bindings. Currently these are only available for Ubuntu 18.04. We are working on providing 20.04 Qt5 support. Full installation instructions are available on the [MeqTrees Wiki](https://github.com/ska-sa/meqtrees/wiki).
